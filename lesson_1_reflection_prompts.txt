How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed the exact place where things changed and this helped in focusing the attention. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps me to look back at my previous code to check for any undesirable changes made. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Commits will be more logical and we can revert to any point if we have to. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    As in git we are more concerned about jumping back in time for code state and revert it to get state of code at that point of time. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	log will give me list of changes and I can use diff to find the changes in history. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We can now revert to working state even when we break some stuff. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For everything. TO save my progress in docs, etc
