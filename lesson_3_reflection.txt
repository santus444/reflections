When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to 
  - share my work with others
  - collaborate with others. 
  - backup my work in place other than my local machine. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
We might be working on local and would like to wait. 
We dont want to pull every time some one commits as we might not need that branch or commit.
